<h3>Scaler Vector Machine and ROC</h3>
<p> This data product plots ROC curves for a Scaler Vector Machine model
  for predicting whether activity recording of atheletes are in a defined
  group of classe's(A,B,C,D,E). The SVM parameter gamma is user adjustable.
  The ROC plots curves both for the training set(black) and test set(red).
</p>
<p> Note that the gamma slider is reactive but not the checkboxes.
  When you make a change to the groupings, you must click the "apply" button.
  This retrains the svm model and recalculates the ROC curve, plots the
  mapping and writes out the confusion matrix. The data is the same used in the
  project used in "Practical Machine Learning" except that is a random subsample
  of 2000. Also only two features are kept: roll_belt and pitch_belt.
</p>
<p> The cost slider is also reactive(changes will automatically cause the SVM model
    to retrain and predict new result). The Cost factor in SVM.
